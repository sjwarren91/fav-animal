    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
        The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronunciation: [ˈʃɛːfɐˌhʊnt]) is a breed of medium to
        large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. In the English language, the breed's officially recognized
        name is German Shepherd Dog (sometimes abbreviated as GSD). The breed was officially known as the Alsatian in
        Britain until 1977 when its name was changed back to German Shepherd.[citation needed] Despite its primitive,
        wolf-like appearance the German Shepherd is a relatively modern breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899.
        As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since
        that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around
        the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance,
        search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and acting. The German Shepherd is the second-most registered
        breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United
        Kingdom.

    <h2>Temperament</h2>
    <p>
        German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.The breed
        is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them
        excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective of their family and
        territory, especially if not socialized correctly. They are not inclined to become immediate friends with
        strangers. German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as being protective of their
        owners.
